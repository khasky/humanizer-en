"""Run the regular expressions from references/chatbot-artifacts.md
against the test samples from references/test-fixtures.md.

Each regex passes three levels:
  1. Positive sample  — the regex must fire.
  2. Negative sample  — similar but non-machine text; must not fire.
  3. Boundary sample  — empty string and multiple matches; no crashes.

Standard library only. Run:  python3 scripts/check_markers.py
Exit code 0 — all checks pass, 1 — there are failures.

When a new regex is added to chatbot-artifacts.md, a block with samples is
added here, and the paired samples go into references/test-fixtures.md.
No working rule is ever removed (see the principle in test-fixtures.md).
