# Test fixtures for the regular expressions

Introduced in v2.3. This file collects the reference "sample / expectation" pairs for every regex in `chatbot-artifacts.md`. These samples are used to verify the regexes before publishing changes to the skill.

Each regex passes three checks:

- **Positive sample** — the regex must fire.
- **Negative sample** — similar text unrelated to AI. The regex must not fire.
- **Boundary sample** — empty string, multiple matches, Unicode. The regex must not break.

The automated run is `python3 scripts/check_markers.py` (also in CI). A manual PowerShell variant is given at the end of the file.

## Full before/after pairs for content editing

### Example 1: Marketing text with AI tells

**Before:**

> 🚀 **Innovation:** This software is undoubtedly a testament to our commitment to quality. Moreover, **it represents the perfect place for synergy**, delivering a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience — ensuring efficiency from novices to professionals. Industry experts believe this project lays the foundation for future wins. I hope this text is helpful for your presentation! :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**After:**

> We added batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode. Testers say the interface is simpler and tasks finish faster.

**What was fixed:**

- Removed the marker `:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}` (`chatbot-artifacts.md`, section A.1).
- Removed the emoji and excess bold (patterns #16, #17).
- Removed the leftover chat turn "I hope this…" (pattern #22).
- Cut the inflated significance and averaging (patterns #1, #2).
- Removed the rule of three "seamless, intuitive, and powerful" (pattern #13).
- Removed the vague attribution "Industry experts believe" (pattern #6).
- Removed the false range "from novices to professionals" (pattern #15).

### Example 2: A biography with a fabricated source

**Before:**

> Ivan Petrov is an eminent physicist whose contribution to quantum mechanics forever changed the field. He published his major works in the Journal of Applied Physics (DOI:10.5555/vol.2020.42), where he revealed revolutionary principles of entanglement. His research was widely covered in leading scientific outlets, underscoring the significance of his legacy for future generations of scientists.

**What is wrong (unedited, for verification):**

- The DOI is fabricated (the prefix 10.5555 is reserved for tests and is not issued to real journals).
- "Revolutionary principles of entanglement" — inflated significance.
- "Widely covered" — a vague attribution.
- "An eminent physicist" — averaging.
- "Underscoring the significance of his legacy" — inflated significance.

**After verification:** If the author cannot provide real links and confirm the facts, the article cannot be published. The text is rewritten to the minimally verifiable claim:

> Information about Ivan Petrov's work needs verification. The list of publications is not confirmed in public databases.

### Example 3: Text with em-dashes in literary prose

**Before:**

> The morning was like that — crisp, clear, thin. The town still slept — only the odd footstep echoed back. She walked slowly — because there was nowhere to hurry.

**Analysis:**

- An em-dash in every sentence — a tell?
- No markers from `chatbot-artifacts.md`.
- No AI vocabulary (pattern #10).
- No inflated significance.
- Just em-dashes in a literary description.

**Conclusion:** This is a **false positive**. The em-dash is a normal authorial device in literary prose. See `false-positives.md`, item 1. Do not edit the text.

---

### Example 4: A legal document with officialese

**Before:**

> Pursuant to this Agreement and in accordance with applicable law, for the purpose of ensuring the performance of obligations, the Parties shall undertake to carry out activities directed at achieving the objectives set forth in Appendix 1.

**Analysis:**

- Officialese is present (pattern #8).
- Little concrete content.

**Conclusion:** This is a legal document. Officialese is a mandatory genre norm. See `false-positives.md`, item 5. Do not edit for "humanity" — it would lose legal force.

## Empirical verification of the regular expressions

**The primary method (since v2.6) is the automated run.** Every regex from `chatbot-artifacts.md` is checked by a standard-library Python script — three levels per regex (positive, negative, boundary sample plus multiple matches):

```bash
python3 scripts/check_markers.py
```

The script runs in CI (`.github/workflows/regex-check.yml`) on every PR that touches `scripts/` or files with markers. A local run before release is mandatory. When a new regex is added, its samples go into the script and into the "Samples for the regular expressions" section above.

**The alternative method is PowerShell.** A manual check for a Windows environment with no Python:

```powershell
$test = @{
  oaicite_full = @{
    pattern = ':contentReference\[oaicite:\d+\]\{index=\d+\}'
    positive = 'According to :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, the figures check out.'
    negative = 'The word oaicite is mentioned in an article about AI.'
  }
  oai_citation = @{
    pattern = 'oai_citation:\d+‡'
    positive = 'oai_citation:5‡Wiki source'
    negative = 'oai_citation with no colon'
  }
  turn_search = @{
    pattern = 'turn\d+search\d+'
    positive = 'turn0search0'
    negative = 'turn around and search'
  }
  utm_chatgpt = @{
    pattern = '[?&]utm_source=chatgpt\.com'
    positive = 'https://example.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com'
    negative = 'utm_source=chatgpt.com mentioned in the text'
  }
  utm_openai = @{
    pattern = '[?&]utm_source=openai'
    positive = 'https://docs.example.com/?utm_source=openai'
    negative = 'OpenAI utm_source with no query sign'
  }
  attached_file = @{
    pattern = 'attached_file:\/\/'
    positive = 'attached_file:///tmp/file.pdf'
    negative = 'See the attached file (plain English)'
  }
  grok_card = @{
    pattern = 'grok_card:\/\/'
    positive = 'grok_card://1234567890'
    negative = 'a Grok card with no special markup'
  }
  vertexai = @{
    pattern = 'vertexaisearch\.cloud\.google\.com/grounding-api-redirect'
    positive = 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/abc'
    negative = 'cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-search'
  }
  copilot_caret = @{
    pattern = '\[\^\d+\^\]'
    positive = 'The market grew 12%[^1^] per the report'
    negative = 'A normal Markdown footnote[^1] below'
  }
  assistants_source = @{
    pattern = '【\d+(?::\d+)?†source】'
    positive = 'the policy【1†source】allows it'
    negative = 'decorative corners 【note】'
  }
  cite_turn = @{
    pattern = 'citeturn\d+[a-z]+\d+'
    positive = 'text citeturn0file0 link'
    negative = 'cite, then turn to page 5'
  }
  sandbox_link = @{
    pattern = '\]\(sandbox:/mnt/data/'
    positive = '[Download](sandbox:/mnt/data/r.xlsx)'
    negative = 'a sandbox on the server /mnt/data'
  }
}

foreach ($name in $test.Keys) {
  $t = $test[$name]
  $pos = $t.positive -match $t.pattern
  $neg = $t.negative -match $t.pattern
  $ok = $pos -and (-not $neg)
  $status = if ($ok) { 'OK' } else { 'FAIL' }
  Write-Host ('{0,-18} {1}  pos={2}  neg={3}' -f $name, $status, $pos, $neg)
}
```

The PowerShell variant shows 12 regexes as a sample of manual checking. The full run of all 23 (including truncated forms, the invisible characters from A.7 and A.10, the file_search markers, and the Gemini markers) is performed by `scripts/check_markers.py` — that is the canonical one. The same script can scan arbitrary text: `python3 scripts/check_markers.py --scan file.md`.

## Principle of use

If a new regex or a new tell is added to the skill — it must get three test samples in this file before publication. This file serves as an automated test set for regression protection.

When the flagship model changes (see `llm-fingerprints.md`), you must:

1. Check whether the tool-output format has changed.
2. If so — add new regexes with samples.
3. Keep the old regexes for text of the earlier era.

The "no regressions" principle: no working rule is ever removed.
